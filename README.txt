# CRM Full-Stack – Agil Energy
Internal CRM developed from scratch during my final-year project using Angular, Spring Boot and MySQL.
The application manages prospects, clients, products, and quotations, with role-based access and a clean separation between frontend and backend.

## Tech Stack
- Angular
- Spring Boot
- MySQL

## Project Structure
- `/frontend` : Angular application
- `/backend` : Spring Boot REST API

This project was built to apply full-stack development principles, system analysis, and clean architecture in a real-world use case.
